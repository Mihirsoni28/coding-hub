## Gamma AI Clone

The `gamma_clone.py` script provides a minimal example of how you could build
a presentation generator similar to **Gamma AI**. It uses the OpenAI API to
create slide content and outputs an HTML file.

### Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
3. Generate a presentation:
   ```bash
   python3 gamma_clone.py "Your topic" --slides 5 --output presentation.html
   ```
4. See all options:
   ```bash
   python3 gamma_clone.py --help
   ```

The resulting `presentation.html` will contain a simple slide deck generated by
the language model.
